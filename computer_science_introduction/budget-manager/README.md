# Budget Manager
## Description
Are you aware of your daily expenses?
Are you manually writing all your expenses in a note?
Are you manually calculating all your expenses with a calculator?
This application acts as your budgeting supervisor to keep in check your finances!
It helps you by keeping all your expenses organized without any stress.
At the same time it gives you an overview on what you are spending your money.

With this app I wanted to put in practice all the things learnt through all the lessons of the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.
In partuclar in this project I used:
- Python
- SQL
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Flask
And I've been inspired by the [Problem set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/) of week 9 on Flask: 

## Usage
### Instructions
Before using the app you first need to create an account by clicking the Register button in the top right corner.
Once created you will be able to log into your account and you can now track your expenses!

- **Budget Overview:** This section gives you an overview of your current budget situation. It shows your total budget, total expenses, and the remaining balance. You can see a breakdown of your expenses by category, helping you understand where your money is going.
- **Set Budget:** This section allows you to set your budget. You can define a monthly budget that you want to stick to. This helps you plan your finances better and avoid overspending.
- **Add Expense:** This section allows you to add a new expense based on predefined categories. You can enter the amount, select a category, and add a description for the expense. This makes it easy to keep track of all your spending.
- **Remove Expense:** This section allows you to remove a specific expense. If you made a mistake or no longer want to track a particular expense, you can easily delete it from your records.
- **Balance:** This section shows you the expenses by category. You can see how much you have spent in each category and compare it to your budget. This helps you identify areas where you might need to cut back.
 
 ### Examples
 - **Setting a Budget:** If you want to set a monthly budget of $1000, you can enter this amount in the "Set Budget" section. The app will then track your expenses against this budget and show you how much you have left to spend.
- **Adding an Expense:** Suppose you spent $50 on Travel. You can add this expense by selecting the "Travel" category, entering the amount, and providing a description like "Flight to Milan."
